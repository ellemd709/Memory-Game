This is my final project with Getcoding. I have put together a memory game where I use css to syle my game; basic html and vanilla javascript.
I decided to honour Pride month in our province with a Pride theme. 
This project is based on the children’s card game, where the player tries to match pairs of cards that are flipped over. The player is shown how many moves score and a timer to determin how long to complete the game. If the player successfully matches all of the cards, a “win” message is displayed.
