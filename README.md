# PRIDE MEMORY GAME
This project is based on the children’s card game, where the player tries to match pairs of cards that are flipped over. The player is shown how many moves they use and a timer to determin how long to complete the game.


# Reflection
This is my final project I did with my coach Gillian. 
Learning from Gillian was a great experience and I found her helpful and always leading an ear to help me solve most of my issues I was having such as flipping the cards back once clicked if not a match and shuffling the cards. 
Javascript challenged me in many ways to think outside the box. 
I enjoyed putting this project together and seeing the final result and showing my family and friends.

I am currently working on a larger game with 20 cards using similar code to keep JavaScript in my brain. 


# How To Play

- Click start button OR click a card to start game
- Click 2 cards and determin is a match is made
- Determine if two selected cards are a match; if match stay visible; if not a match flip back
- Once all matches are found; win board is shown with a win board with time and moves and a replay button

# Overview

I have put together a memory game where I use css to syle my game; basic html and vanilla javascript.
The game contains;

- Duplicate the cards to have 2 sets of 6
- Start Button
- Timer and moves counter 
- Randomize the display of cards
- Show back of card initially and flip on select
- Show image of front of card 
- Flip back in not a match
- Stay visible if a match 
- Only allow two cards to be selected at a time
- Once all cards selected and Win Message displayed 

I decided to honour Pride month in our province (June) with a Pride theme. 
This project is based on the children’s card game, where the player tries to match pairs of cards that are flipped over. The player is shown how many moves they use and a timer to determin how long to complete the game. 
If the player successfully matches all of the cards, a “win” message is displayed with how many moves and how long you took to win!
