# Reflection
This is my final project I did with my coach Gillian. I decided to honour Pride in our province and used CSS, HTML and vanilla JavaScript. Memory game is a simple yet fun game for all ages to enjoy. 
The parts I struggled with were flipping the cards once clicked if not a match and shuffling the cards.
I am currently working on a larger game with 20 cards using similar code. 


# How To Play

- Click start button OR click a card to start game
- Display 12 cards.
- Duplicate the cards to have 2 sets of 6
- Randomize the display of cards
- Show back of card initially and flip on select
- Only allow two cards to be selected at a time.
- Determine if two selected cards are a match; if match stay visible; if not a match flip back
- once all matches are found; win board is shown with a win board with time and moves and a replay button

# Overview

I have put together a memory game where I use css to syle my game; basic html and vanilla javascript.
I decided to honour Pride month in our province (June) with a Pride theme. 
This project is based on the children’s card game, where the player tries to match pairs of cards that are flipped over. The player is shown how many moves they use and a timer to determin how long to complete the game. 
If the player successfully matches all of the cards, a “win” message is displayed with how many moves and how long you took to win!
